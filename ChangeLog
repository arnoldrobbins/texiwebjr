	* texiwebjr.twjr: jrweave done enough that what it produces
	can be formatted with TeX.  Still lots to go.

	* texiwebjr.twjr: Misc minor changes. Some serious ones blown
	away by accidentally doing them in the .texi file. Duh.

	* texiwebjr.twjr: More improvements in jrtangle, especially
	towards post-processing. Preprocessing step added.
	* bootstrapping: New directory with simple bootstrapping scripts.
	This may go away eventually.
