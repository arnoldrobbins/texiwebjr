	* texiwebjr.twjr: Improve shell debugging. Start on changing
	duplicated code to instead use common chunks, after all this
	is Literate Programming.  Some prose reformatting and
	clean up.

	* texiwebjr.twjr: Fix a number of problems in jrtangle and
	lots of progress on jrweave. Use braces for file chunks.
	Allow printing of initial setup script. Add debugging of shell
	scripts (could use more work). Add more stuff to consider
	doing. Also a fair amount of prose cleanups.

	* texiwebjr.twjr: jrweave done enough to produce a reasonable
	looking document.  Lots of cleanup left to do, as well as
	dumping the cross references.

	Fix up printing of leading macros; remove the original ones.

	* texiwebjr.twjr: jrweave done enough that what it produces
	can be formatted with TeX.  Still lots to go.

	* texiwebjr.twjr: Pretty much finished the full jrtangle,
	and also adding placeholders for additional chapters.

2013-11-07         Arnold D. Robbins     <arnold@skeeve.com>

	* texiwebjr.twjr: Misc minor changes. Some serious ones blown
	away by accidentally doing them in the .texi file. Duh.

2013-11-06         Arnold D. Robbins     <arnold@skeeve.com>

	* texiwebjr.twjr: More improvements in jrtangle, especially
	towards post-processing. Preprocessing step added.
	* bootstrapping: New directory with simple bootstrapping scripts.
	This may go away eventually.

2013-11-05         Arnold D. Robbins     <arnold@skeeve.com>

	* texiwebjr.twjr: Initial git checkin. Bootstrap of jrtangle
	was accomplished on 2013-11-04.
	* texinfo.tex: Initial checkin.
	* COPYING: Initial checkin.
	* README: Added, before push to github.
