============================

This is TexiWeb Jr., a super simple literate programming system built
on top of Texinfo and implemented in awk.

The "tangle" piece was successfully bootstrapped on November 4, 2013.
The "weave" piece started producing a reasonable-looking document
on November 11, 2013.

As of today, both the source code and literate programming document
are licensed under the GNU GPL. See the file COPYING.

Enjoy,
