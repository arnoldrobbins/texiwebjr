It's pretty unwise to take my answer as authoritative.  I can't
find anything specific in either the Chicago Manual of Style nor
Words Into Type (my two reference sources for such matters), but
examples in the latter suggest that the second form (comma before
superscript) is the right one.  I also looked at some legal documents,
and they too put the reference after the punctuation.  In the absence
of actual knowledge, that's what I would go with.
