Hi Arnold,

I committed a new texinfo.tex (also attached) which always uses the
"DVI" style for @uref and always prints in black.  If one actually wants
color, e.g.,
@tex
\gdef\urlcolor{1 0 0}% red
\gdef\linkcolor{0 0 1}% blue
@end tex

I'll test and document that in a bit, but just thought you might want to
try the code before I push it out.

Thanks,
k

    So there's no way to get the embedded link style anymore?

There's another "secret" option for that.
@tex
\global\urefurlonlylinktrue
@end tex

    Happy Thanksgiving,

You too :).

    Is there an easy way to translate "mils" into "lines"? 

Nothing's easy, exactly, but you could do @showthe@baselineskip to see
the line spacing and then do the multiplication.
E.g., if the line spacing is 12pt, that's 1/6 in, so
2 lines = 1/3 inch = 333 mil?  
(Depends on if you're using @smallbook, @fontsize, etc.)

    "I need at least the following N lines to
    be kept together and not broken across a page".
    
@group?

    Mils (1/1000 of an inch?) seems a funny unit to have to work in.

It's completely bogus IMHO.  Chassell invented it back in the early
days, for no good reason that I know of.

However, since @need (and @group) are relatively rarely used, and even
less actually needed, I'm not so inclined to worry about improving the
units.
